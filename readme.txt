QuickCopy is a simple single-page mini app meant to be useful for someone who may need to copy data into forms or similar on a regular basis. Input files should have each data point formatted like this:

####Header, title, or description
<Data to be copied>

Simply drop such a file onto the box labeled "Drop file here!" and it will populate the page. Then click an element and it will be copied to the clipboard.
